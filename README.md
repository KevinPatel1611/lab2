This repository contains an example of how to use a Random Forest Classifier and Lopgistic Regression model to perform supervised learning on a dataset.
A Random Forest Classifier is a machine learning model that consists of many decision trees that vote on the final prediction. 
It is suitable for both classification and regression tasks, and it can handle large and complex datasets with high accuracy and speed.
A Logistic Regression model is a machine learning model that uses a logistic function to estimate the probability of a binary outcome, such as yes or no, true or false, positive or negative.
It is suitable for classification tasks, such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, or medical diagnosis.
